A text adventure -- Dumb Wumpus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRO)

The sound of raindrops awakes you up from your sleep. Your first thoughts are
immediate fear. You're not in your bedroom. Instead, you in some form of room?
It's quite hard to see your surrondings. You instinctly reach for your light,
but your left hand finds nothing to grab onto. You look down and realize that
you've been sleeping on cold hard rock. You then look up and see the giant hole
in the ceiling, illuminated by moonlight. You vaguely see the number '1'
chiseled on the floor. After getting up, you try to search your pockets for
your pistol and cellphone, but instead you feel some crumbled up object. Using
the moonlight, you can faintly make out the words "Wumpus" and "escape".
Wumpus. Wumpus. You've heard that name before. After pondering for a moment
on the meaning of the word, you can faintly hear some form of roar from one
corner of the room. You slowly walk up and faintly see some number
displayed on a plaque above a hole. Suddenly, the room is illuminated.
You then notice that this hole is the only way out of this room. It's time
to get out of here.


So how many rooms?
       1 2 3 4 5
       6 7 8 9 a
       b c
		   b --> c (exit 2)	
                   |
       1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5 (Dead end)
             |
  (Dead end) 7 <-- 4 -> 6 (Dead End)
	     |
	     8 --> 9 --> a (exit 1)

5, 6, 7 are where the wumpus is located,
a, c are exits

I have no idea if I can uses classes for this, so what I can do

Each room:
     has a reference to a rooms(or none)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acutally, that's too complicated for this exercise
Using the following rooms:
1 2 3 4 5 6

      3 (Dead End)
      |
1 --> 2
      |
6 <-- 4 --> 5 (Exit)

Rooms 3 and 6 are dead ends (3 is Wumpus, 6 is trap)
5 is exit room (Escape)
1 Has hole in ceiling, is illuminated
2: Faint awful smell, two rooms
3: Wumpus, kill you from the smell
4: Hear a faint wind coming from some room
5: You are out of the dungeon.
6: You fall into a bottomless pit and die.
